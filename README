Project Charon is a Windows Multitool for finding and fixing various problems that seem to get
missed by most other tools.

Supported Operating Systems:
XP, Vista, 7, and 8
32 bit and 64 bit

Currently supported tools/fixes:
~Fixing registry corruption causing Windows to not detect CD/DVD drives.
~Resetting the HP Recovery Media Creation software to allow more copies to be made.
~Running the SFC tool for Windows and generating a log in Vista, 7, and 8 (used for attempting to find and repair minor OS corruption while booted).
~Registering or unregistering every .dll in a folder.

Any further suggested tools/fixes are welcomed.

This is a completely open source project. Feel free to download, add to, copy from, redistribute.
My only request is to please give project members credit for original work.

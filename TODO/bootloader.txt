Boot with the Seven DVD and go into Recovery Environment select "command prompt"

NOTE:- the reference here is Vista same for Seven. Just substitute Seven for Vista 

The first order of business is to make sure the MBR and bootsector contain the right references to the Vista bootloader:

Replace x: in the commands below with the letter to your CD drive as detected by the Windows Recovery environment, at the prompt type:- (pressing enter after each line)

bootrec.exe /fixmbr
x:\boot\bootsect.exe /nt60 all /force

Now we get rid of the old BCD registry, and create a new one instead.
Note: We're assuming that the boot drive is drive C: below. If your computer is configured differently, be sure to use the appropriate drive letter here instead.

del C:\boot\bcd
bcdedit /createstore c:\boot\bcd.temp
bcdedit.exe /store c:\boot\bcd.temp /create {bootmgr} /d "Windows Boot Manager"
bcdedit.exe /import c:\boot\bcd.temp
bcdedit.exe /set {bootmgr} device partition=C:
bcdedit.exe /timeout 10
del c:\boot\bcd.temp

Now we have a clean, working Vista bootloader. But we need to add a Vista entry to it:

bcdedit.exe /create /d "Windows Vista" /application osloader
bcdedit.exe should return a message with a GUID for the newly-created entry, something like this:
The entry {c0dfc4fa-cb21-11dc-81bf-005056c00008} was successfully created.

You'll need to use the value that bcdedit.exe returned for you below, along with the drive letter for the drive that Windows Vista is installed to:

bcdedit.exe /set {c0dfc4fa-cb21-11dc-81bf-005056c00008} device partition=C:
bcdedit.exe /set {c0dfc4fa-cb21-11dc-81bf-005056c00008} osdevice partition=C:
bcdedit.exe /set {c0dfc4fa-cb21-11dc-81bf-005056c00008} path \Windows\system32\winload.exe
bcdedit.exe /set {c0dfc4fa-cb21-11dc-81bf-005056c00008} systemroot \Windows
And, last of all, tell the Vista bootloader to boot the new entry by default:

bcdedit.exe /displayorder {c0dfc4fa-cb21-11dc-81bf-005056c00008}
bcdedit.exe /default {c0dfc4fa-cb21-11dc-81bf-005056c00008}

Now the Vista bootloader has been nuked and rebuilt from scratch.
